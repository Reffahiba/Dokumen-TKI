As defined in this way, information retrieval used to be an activity that only
a few people engaged in: reference librarians, paralegals, and similar pro-
fessional searchers. Now the world has changed, and hundreds of millions
of people engage in information retrieval every day when they use a web
search engine or search their email.1
